# OOPpingpong

Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. ... A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions.
